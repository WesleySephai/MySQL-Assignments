Creating a database company, showing the database
Using the followng languages

DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE

 • DDL stands for data definition language.​
 
 • DDL Commands deal with the schema, i.e., the table in which our data is stored.​
 
 • All the structural changes such as creation, deletion and alteration on the table can be carried with the DDL commands in SQL.

  • Commands covered under DDL are: 1. CREATE 2. ALTER 3. DROP 4. TRUNCATE 5. RENAME


DML
 
 • DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. Using DML commands in SQL, we can make changes in the data present in tables.
 
 •  DML commands in SQL will change the data, such as inserting new records, deleting or updating existing records from the SQL tables. We can also retrieve all the data from SQL tables according to our requirements.

  • Commands covered under DML are: 1. INSERT 2. SELECT 3. UPDATE 4. DELETE


DCL

 • DCL stands for Data Control Language.
 
 • Whenever we want to control the access to the data present in SQL tables, we will use DCL commands in SQL. Only the authorized users can access the data stored in the tables.

TCL
 • TCL stands for Transaction Control Language. TCL commands are generally used in transactions.
 
 • Using TCL commands in SQL, we can save our transactions to the database using COMMIT and roll them back to a specific point in our transaction using ROLLBACK. We can also save a particular portion of our transaction using the SAVEPOINT command.
